I used to have a faulty 2tb drive that had a rare habit of completely getting rid of entire folders and files (because I owned that crap since I was 12 and I have definitely dropped it multiple times), and recently I've got a new 4tb hard drive and I created an image of the 2tb, and now that I don't have to worry about excess usage of the drive causing something bad to happen I could check my backups against the actual folders and files to see how much, if at all, the 2tb actually corrupted files, and if the 2tb made any files sprout back from the dead. And this is why I wasted about an entire week on this. I made a dotnet version of this aswell but had to scrap it since linux can't properly run dotnet programs because linux is a dumpster fire. (I had to use linux because I had to mount the 2tb image for this)
